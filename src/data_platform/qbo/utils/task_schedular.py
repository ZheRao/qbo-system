"""
src.data_platform.qbo.silver.task_schedular

Purpose:
    - create spark jobs as a list of dictionaries, so the meta-data (invariants) of each job is encoded into one single element of the list

Exposed API:
    - `create_jobs` - returns a list of dictionaries with keys `['company', 'start', 'end']`

Note for creating jobs:
    - Must have 
        - company
        - start
        - end
    - Other consideration
        - auth token: instead of appending the token to each task and take up a lot of space,   
        just broadcast the auth dictionary, after refresh every company, to ingest Spark jobs
        - bronze path: can be derived from company + start_year + start_month
        - silver path: Spark partitioned by Company and Fiscal Year - broadcast to jobs
